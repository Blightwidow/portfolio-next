      <h1>Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        I have been building website for more than 6 years. These projects have range from small portfolios, like the one you are on right
        now, to massive multimillion dollars company homepages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a firm believe that getting things done is the key to success. As such I tend to avoid flashy new tech and keep to the basics.
        Most of my work use React, NextJS and a backend with the appropriate language for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        That does not prevent me from also checking out new things and trying things. Below are some examples that I can share of projects I
        had a big contribution to.
